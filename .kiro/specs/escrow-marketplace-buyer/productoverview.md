# Product Overview

The Escrow Marketplace is a buyer-focused platform for purchasing second-hand electronics with built-in escrow protection.

## Problem Statement
Traditional resale platforms rely on blind trust, leading to fraud, damaged products, and payment disputes.

## Solution
This platform introduces:
- Escrow-held payments
- Buyer-side product verification
- Open-box delivery
- Structured dispute resolution

Funds are released to the seller only after buyer approval, creating trust by design.
